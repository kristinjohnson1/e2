## Game planning 
+ Create an array with possible moves, 3 elements : rock, paper, scissors
+ For both players, use a random number generator (0-2) to assign a value from array 
+ Create an empty string for winner
+ Compare Player1 and Player2, if player one is rock and Player2 is scissors, or Player1 is paper and Player2 is rock or Player1 is scissors and Player2 is paper, Player1 is the winner
+ If Player1 and Player2 are the same value, it is a tie
+ Otherwise, Player2 is the winner
+ Output the results to the page : Player1's throw, Player2's throw and the result
